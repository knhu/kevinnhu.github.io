                    <h1>Hi, thank you for visiting my website.</h1>
                    <p>My name is Kevin Nhu, and I am a Graduate Master's student studying Computer Science at UC Davis with a passion for software development and artificial intelligence. I previously graduated from the University of San Diego with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. Ever since first learning python from an instructor my parents privately hired when I was 13, I became instantly hooked on coding. Since then, I've taken up multiple projects in multiple programming languages ranging from registration systems to games. Besides coding, my other interests include reading, swimming, biking, speed typing, and building mechanical keyboards.</p>
                    <p>I'm currently open to internship opportunities for Fall 2022 or Spring 2023. If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to contact me by email at <a href = "mailto: knhu@sandiego.edu">knhu@sandiego.edu</a> or connect with me on my <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/kevinnhu">Linkedin</a> profile.
